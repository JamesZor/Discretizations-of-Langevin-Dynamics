# Discretizations-of-Langevin-Dynamics

Conducted an in-depth investigation and analysis of the BAOAB and UBU discretizations of Langevin Dynamics on one-dimensional potentials. Evaluated the accuracy of these two methods in approximating the invariant distribution of the nonlinear system. Implemented a fast autocorrelation function in Python to examine any differences between the methods in their convergence to equilibrium.
